    <h2>Definition</h2>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="text">

            <p><b>Permaculture</b> is a holistic approach to agricultural and land management design
                that attempts to mimic patterns found in natural ecosystems. It is a design system
                that aims to create sustainable human habitats by integrating ecology, landscape,
                organic gardening, architecture, and agroforestry in a harmonious and mutually beneficial way.
                <br><br>Some of its goals are:

                        <li>Preventing pollution</li>
                        <li>Increasing sustainability</li>
                        <li>Protecting wildlife</li>
                        <li>Improving the land's resiliency and productivity</li>

    <h2>Ethics</h2>
    
    <div class="text">
        Permaculture starts with ethics.
        From a Permaculture perspective, ethical actions are simply those that support life, and unethical actions
        are the ones that harm or destroy life needlessly.
        Ethics are the foundations of this design system and all actions must abide by the three ethics of permaculture:

        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
                Ethic #1: Care for Earth
        </div>
            <div class="text">
                This ethic emphasizes the need to respect and care for all living
                and non-living elements of the Earth's ecosystems.
            </div><br>

        <div class="subsection">
                Ethic #2: Care for People
        </div>
            <div class="text">
                This ethic focuses on meeting the needs of individuals and communities
                in ways that are sustainable and equitable, promoting social justice and well-being.
            </div><br>

        <div class="subsection">
            Ethic #3: Fair Share
        </div>
            <div class="text">This ethic advocates for the fair distribution of resources
                and the sharing of surplus to ensure that everyone's needs are met
                without overexploiting resources or creating inequality.</div><br>

        <h2>Principles</h2>

        <div class="text">
            Permaculture principles are guidelines and concepts derived from observations of natural systems,
            designed to inform and guide the practice of permaculture. With the three ethics as their cornerstone,
            the principles serve as a framework for decision-making and design, emphasizing sustainable
            and regenerative approaches to human settlement and agriculture.<br><br><br>
